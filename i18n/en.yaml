  translation: "Hello my name is Kate. I am 22 years old. I draw all my life since my childhood. More than 2 years ago, I understood that I want to do tattoos. I was studying in St. Petersburg, my teacher was famous tattoo artist, after training I started to work with him in tattoo shop.
It is wonderful feeling  to observe as your work moving from the sheet of paper to the body and started to live itâ€™s own life."
